If you’ve ever tried to value a private company, you’ve probably run into this question: What discount rate should I use? The standard answer is to use something like the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**. But CAPM was designed for public companies with clear market data, not for private businesses with more unknowns than certainties. And yet, many investors still try to apply it. Why? Because it’s the best thing they have. But just because it’s the best tool available doesn’t mean it’s the right tool for the job.

## What is CAPM?

CAPM is supposed to tell you how much return an investor should expect for taking on a certain level of risk. The formula looks like this:

$$ \text{Expected Return} = R_f + \beta (R_m - R_f) $$

Where:

- $R_f$​ is the risk-free rate (usually the return on government bonds).
- $\beta$ is a measure of how much the company’s returns move with the market.
- $R_m$​ is the expected return of the market as a whole.

The idea is that an investor needs to be compensated for two things: the time value of money (that’s the $R_f$ part) and the risk of investing in something volatile (that’s the $\beta(R_m - R_f)$ part).

For public companies, this works reasonably well. You can look up the risk-free rate in about 30 seconds, and there’s tons of data on how a public company’s stock moves relative to the market (that’s how you figure out β\betaβ). So, for public companies, the CAPM formula gives you a pretty good estimate of the discount rate you should use in a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** valuation.

But what about private companies?

## The Problem with CAPM for Private Companies

The problem is that private companies don’t have stock prices. They don’t trade on open markets, so you can’t measure how their returns correlate with the broader market. No stock price means no β\betaβ. So how do you use CAPM?

Most people just _make up_ a β\betaβ. They look at similar public companies and use their β\betaβ as an estimate. But that’s a pretty big leap. Public companies, especially large ones, tend to be more stable and diversified than private companies. A private company’s risk profile is often completely different.

Worse, private companies tend to be owned by a small group of individuals, usually the founders or early investors, who are deeply involved in the business. Their personal wealth is often tied up in the company, and they can’t diversify their risk by holding a portfolio of stocks like a public market investor can. This changes the nature of risk for them—what might be a small risk for a public company can be an existential threat for a private one.

So when you use CAPM for a private company, you’re trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. It might give you a discount rate, but it’s probably not the right one.

## Why Investors Still Use CAPM

So why do investors still use CAPM in private company valuations? Part of it is habit. CAPM is what they were taught in business school, and it works well enough for public companies. When they move to the private realm, they just keep using it because it’s familiar.

Another reason is that CAPM, despite its flaws, gives you a number. And when you’re valuing a private company, having a number—any number—feels better than nothing. Valuation is inherently uncertain, and CAPM at least brings some structure to the process. It gives investors a way to quantify risk, even if the risk in a private company is very different from what CAPM assumes.

But the biggest reason is that _everyone else is doing it_. If you’re an investor and you want to raise money or justify a valuation to your partners, you need to follow the same rules they do. CAPM is part of the shared language of finance. It’s not perfect, but it’s a convention, and conventions matter. If you show up to a board meeting with a valuation based on some other model no one’s heard of, you’re going to get strange looks.

## What’s the Alternative?

If CAPM isn’t ideal for private companies, what’s the alternative? The truth is, there isn’t a perfect alternative. Valuing companies—especially private companies—is hard. There’s no magic formula. But there are a few things investors can do to get closer to the right answer.

First, they can adjust the discount rate for the specific risks of private companies. The biggest risk for private companies is illiquidity. You can’t sell your shares easily, so you should demand a higher return to compensate for that. A common way to deal with this is to add an “illiquidity premium” to the discount rate. This can range from 3% to 10%, depending on the size and nature of the company.

Another thing investors can do is use a broader definition of risk. CAPM assumes that the only risk that matters is how the company’s returns move relative to the market. But for private companies, there are other risks that might be more important. For example, private companies often depend heavily on a few key customers or suppliers. If one of them pulls out, the whole business could collapse. That’s a different kind of risk than what CAPM measures, and it needs to be factored into the discount rate.

Finally, investors can use multiple methods to triangulate the right discount rate. Instead of relying only on CAPM, they can look at other models, like the **build-up method**, which starts with the risk-free rate and then adds premiums for things like company size, industry risk, and financial health. They can also look at precedent transactions—what similar companies have sold for in the past—and use that as a guide.

## Judgment Over Models

At the end of the day, what CAPM—and really, any valuation model—misses is judgment. Models are useful because they force you to think systematically about risk and return. But they can never capture the full picture, especially for private companies where the risks are often qualitative rather than quantitative.

For example, a private company’s future might depend on the health of its founder. If the founder is 65 and thinking about retiring, the company’s prospects could change dramatically. How do you model that in CAPM? You can’t. Or what if the company is in an industry that’s rapidly changing, like AI or biotech? CAPM assumes the market’s risk premium is constant, but that’s not true in fast-moving industries. The reality is, you have to make a judgment call.

Valuing private companies is more art than science. CAPM is a tool, but it’s not the only one. And in many cases, it’s not even the best one. Investors who rely too heavily on CAPM risk missing the bigger picture. The best investors are the ones who use models like CAPM to inform their judgment, not replace it.

## Conclusion

CAPM is a useful tool for valuing public companies, but it’s not designed for private ones. Private companies have risks that CAPM doesn’t capture—illiquidity, dependency on key individuals, and concentrated customer bases, to name a few. Investors can still use CAPM as part of their valuation process, but they should adjust for the unique risks of private companies and use multiple methods to get a more accurate picture.

At the end of the day, valuing private companies requires judgment. Models like CAPM can help, but they can’t make the decision for you. The real skill in valuation is knowing when to trust the numbers and when to look beyond them.
