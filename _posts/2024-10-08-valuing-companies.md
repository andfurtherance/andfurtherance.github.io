Most people think valuing companies is about numbers. And it is, to an extent. But when it comes to private companies, valuation is more about judgment than math. The numbers are just inputs to a bigger, fuzzier picture. Public companies have stock prices that bounce around constantly, giving you a sense of what the market thinks they’re worth. Private companies don’t have that. So how do you figure out what a private company is worth?

There are a few ways people try to do it, but none of them are perfect. The trick is to understand where they break down and make adjustments accordingly.

## Comparable Company Analysis

One of the first things people do is look for public companies that are similar to the private company and see how much they’re worth. This is called _Comparable Company Analysis_ (CCA). The idea is simple: if public Company A trades at 10 times earnings, maybe private Company B, which is similar, should be worth the same.

But private companies aren’t public companies. For one thing, they’re smaller. And smaller companies are riskier, because they have fewer customers, less market power, and often weaker balance sheets. So you can’t just assume a private company should be worth as much as a public one with similar revenue or profits. You have to adjust for the fact that the private company is more fragile.

There’s also a liquidity problem. If you own shares in a public company, you can sell them pretty easily. Not so in a private company. So investors usually apply a "liquidity discount" to private companies. This can be anywhere from 10% to 30%, depending on how hard it would be to sell the company.

## Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

Another way to value a company is to project its future cash flows and then discount them to their present value. This is called the _Discounted Cash Flow_ method (DCF). It sounds fancy, but it's really just a way of saying: “What is the company going to make in the future, and how much is that worth today?”

DCF works best when a company has predictable cash flows. For example, if you’re valuing a well-established manufacturer with steady revenues, DCF can give you a pretty good estimate of what the business is worth. But if you’re dealing with a startup or a company in a volatile industry, DCF can be less reliable. Why? Because the future is inherently uncertain, and small changes in your assumptions can lead to wildly different valuations.

Even worse, private companies tend to have more unstable cash flows than public companies. Startups, in particular, often burn cash for years before they turn a profit—if they ever do. So applying DCF to a private company is often more guesswork than science.

## Precedent Transactions

Another method people use is _Precedent Transactions_. This involves looking at what similar companies have sold for in the past. For example, if a competitor in the same industry was bought for $100 million last year, that gives you a data point for what your company might be worth.

But deals are often situational. Maybe the buyer really wanted to get into a particular market and overpaid. Maybe the seller was in financial trouble and took a lowball offer. The price of a previous deal doesn’t necessarily reflect the intrinsic value of the company in question. It just tells you what someone was willing to pay at that moment, under those conditions.

## The Real Challenge

The real challenge when valuing private companies is that there are no perfect comparisons. Each company is unique, and private companies, in particular, have idiosyncrasies that make them hard to value accurately. A family-owned business might have been run in a way that maximizes the owner’s lifestyle rather than the company’s growth. Or a startup might be on the verge of a breakthrough that will either make it worth 10x what it is now, or nothing.

Valuing private companies is especially hard because you have to make a lot of assumptions. You assume future revenues will grow at a certain rate. You assume certain costs will remain stable. You assume the market will value the company at a certain multiple in the future. And the more assumptions you make, the more room there is for error.

## Risk and Uncertainty

The biggest difference between public and private companies is risk. Public companies are relatively safe. They’re big, diversified, and have access to capital markets. If their stock price drops, they can issue more shares or take out loans to stay afloat. Private companies don’t have that luxury. They’re more vulnerable to market shocks, and their survival often depends on a few key customers or products.

This is why private company valuations often include a “risk premium.” Investors want to be compensated for taking on more risk. The more volatile the company’s earnings, the bigger the premium. And this premium can be significant—sometimes adding 20% or more to the discount rate in a DCF model.

## Control Premiums and Minority Discounts

Another factor that affects private company valuation is control. If you’re buying a majority stake in a company, you’re usually willing to pay more because you get to call the shots. This is known as a _control premium_. On the flip side, if you’re buying a minority stake, you often pay less because you don’t have the same level of influence over the business. This is called a _minority discount_.

For example, if you’re buying a 5% stake in a private company, you’re probably not going to be able to influence major decisions like dividend payouts or strategic direction. That makes your shares less valuable than if you owned 51% of the company.

## Best Practices

So, how do you value a private company accurately? The truth is, you can’t. Not exactly. But there are best practices that can get you close.

First, use multiple methods. Don’t rely on just one. If CCA tells you the company is worth $50 million, but DCF says it’s worth $20 million, you need to dig deeper. Maybe your growth assumptions in the DCF model are too conservative. Or maybe the comparable public companies aren’t as similar as you thought.

Second, adjust for risk. Private companies have more risk than public ones, so your discount rates should be higher. And don’t forget to apply a liquidity discount—private shares are harder to sell, so they should be worth less.

Finally, be skeptical of your assumptions. Valuation models are only as good as the inputs you put into them. If you assume a private company will grow at 10% per year for the next decade, ask yourself: Why? Is that realistic? What could go wrong? The more you question your assumptions, the more accurate your valuation will be.

## Conclusion

Valuing private companies is tough because there’s no single right answer. The best you can do is triangulate between different methods, adjust for risk, and be honest about the limitations of your assumptions. Valuation is less about finding the exact number and more about understanding the range of possible outcomes. If you can do that, you’ll be ahead of most people.
