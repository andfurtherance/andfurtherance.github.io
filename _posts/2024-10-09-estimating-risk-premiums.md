When we talk about valuing investments, especially in the context of finance and venture capital, one of the trickiest parts is estimating risk premiums. These are the extra returns investors expect to compensate for taking on additional risk. And while some risk premiums—like the equity risk premium—are well-studied and have historical data behind them, others are more nebulous. What’s the premium for industry risk? What about company-specific risks? You won’t find answers in a textbook.

The truth is, estimating risk premiums is part science, part art. There are models and historical averages you can use as a guide, but intuition plays a big role, too. And the best estimates come from a mix of practical experience, gut instinct, and an understanding of the specific circumstances of the investment.

In this essay, I’ll walk through some practical and intuitive ways to estimate different kinds of risk premiums. My goal is to show that while risk premiums can be difficult to quantify, they don’t have to be mysterious. You can make reasonable estimates by thinking clearly about the risks involved and using a few simple heuristics.

## The Equity Risk Premium: History as a Guide

The **equity risk premium** is one of the most well-documented risk premiums, and it’s probably the easiest to estimate. The equity risk premium is the extra return investors expect for investing in stocks rather than risk-free assets like government bonds. Historically, this premium has been around 5-7%, depending on how you measure it and which time period you’re looking at.

So if you're trying to estimate the equity risk premium, the first place to start is with historical data. Look at long-term studies that compare stock market returns to the returns on government bonds. For example, the **Ibbotson SBBI** data set, which tracks U.S. stock and bond returns going back to the 1920s, shows that the average equity risk premium has been about 6% over the long run.

But historical data is only part of the story. The equity risk premium isn’t static. It changes over time based on how investors perceive risk. During times of economic uncertainty—like during the 2008 financial crisis—the equity risk premium tends to rise because investors demand more compensation for taking on risk. During more stable periods, it might be lower.

So while historical data gives you a good starting point, you also need to think about the current economic climate. If you’re valuing a company today, and the world feels particularly uncertain, you might want to use a higher equity risk premium—maybe closer to 7% or 8%. If things are stable and investors seem confident, you might go with a lower premium, around 5%.

The key to estimating the equity risk premium is balancing historical data with a gut sense of current conditions. It’s not just about crunching numbers—it’s about understanding how investors feel about risk right now.

## The Size Premium: Thinking About Fragility

The **size premium** is the extra return investors expect for investing in smaller companies. The logic is simple: smaller companies are riskier than larger ones. They have fewer customers, less market power, and are more vulnerable to economic shocks. So investors demand a higher return to compensate for that risk.

But how do you estimate the size premium? There are studies that quantify the historical size premium for small-cap stocks, and they generally show that smaller companies have provided an extra return of 2-3% over larger companies. But again, this is just a starting point. The size premium can vary widely depending on the specifics of the company you’re valuing.

One intuitive way to think about the size premium is to ask yourself, _How fragile is this company?_ Fragility is a good proxy for risk. A company that depends on a single customer, or that’s burning through cash without a clear path to profitability, is more fragile—and therefore riskier—than a company with a diversified customer base and strong cash flow.

For example, if you’re valuing a small SaaS startup with 10 customers, any one of which could churn at any moment, you might apply a higher size premium—maybe 4% or 5%. But if you’re valuing a more established small business with hundreds of customers and steady revenue, you might go with a lower size premium, closer to 2%.

The size premium is all about understanding how vulnerable the company is to shocks. The more fragile it is, the higher the premium should be.

## The Industry Risk Premium: Look for Disruption

The **industry risk premium** captures the risks unique to the industry a company operates in. Some industries are inherently riskier than others. For example, tech companies face constant disruption and innovation, while utilities operate in a more stable and regulated environment. Investors demand a higher return for investing in risky industries, and that’s what the industry risk premium represents.

Estimating the industry risk premium is tricky because it requires understanding the dynamics of the specific industry. One way to approach it is to ask, _How likely is this industry to be disrupted?_ Disruption is a good proxy for risk. Industries that are ripe for disruption—like retail, media, or transportation—should have higher industry risk premiums. Stable industries, like utilities or consumer staples, should have lower premiums.

For example, if you’re valuing a company in the electric vehicle industry, you might apply a high industry risk premium—maybe 3% or 4%—because the industry is still evolving, and there’s a lot of uncertainty about which companies will succeed. But if you’re valuing a company in the healthcare industry, you might go with a lower premium, around 1% or 2%, because the industry is more established and less likely to be disrupted in the short term.

Another practical approach is to look at **industry betas**. Beta is a measure of how much a stock moves relative to the overall market, and it’s a good proxy for industry risk. Industries with higher average betas—like tech—are riskier, and that should be reflected in a higher industry risk premium. Industries with lower betas—like utilities—are less risky, and should have a lower premium.

The key to estimating the industry risk premium is understanding how much uncertainty and disruption the industry is facing. The more potential for disruption, the higher the premium.

## The Company-Specific Risk Premium: Think Like an Investor

The **company-specific risk premium** is where things get really subjective. This premium reflects the unique risks that apply to the individual company you’re valuing. These could include things like reliance on a single customer, dependence on a key founder, or lack of access to capital. These risks don’t show up in market or industry data, but they’re real, and they affect the company’s cost of equity.

Estimating the company-specific risk premium is more art than science. There’s no formula for it. But one practical approach is to think like an investor. Ask yourself, _If I were investing in this company, what would I be worried about?_ The more worries you have, the higher the premium should be.

For example, if you’re valuing a startup that’s dependent on a single founder who’s also the company’s main salesperson, that’s a big risk. If the founder leaves, the company could fall apart. In that case, you might apply a company-specific risk premium of 3% or 4%. But if you’re valuing a company with a seasoned management team and a diversified customer base, the company-specific risk premium might be closer to 1% or 2%.

Another intuitive way to think about the company-specific risk premium is to ask, _How replaceable is this company?_ If the company has unique intellectual property, a strong brand, or network effects that make it hard to replicate, it’s less risky. But if the company is easily replaceable—if someone else could come in and do the same thing with a little more capital or a better product—it’s riskier, and the premium should be higher.

The company-specific risk premium is all about understanding the unique risks the company faces. The more irreplaceable and resilient the company is, the lower the premium should be. The more fragile and dependent on specific factors, the higher the premium.

## Combining It All: Be Realistic, Not Optimistic

When you’re estimating risk premiums, it’s tempting to be optimistic. You want to believe that the company you’re valuing isn’t that risky, or that the industry is more stable than it really is. But optimism is dangerous in valuation. Risk premiums exist for a reason—they reflect the uncertainty and potential downsides that come with investing in risky ventures.

The best way to estimate risk premiums is to be realistic. Don’t try to convince yourself that a startup with no product and no customers is only a little bit risky. Don’t pretend that an industry facing massive disruption is totally stable. Be honest about the risks, and then apply premiums that reflect those risks.

At the same time, don’t go overboard. Not every startup is a ticking time bomb, and not every industry is about to be disrupted. The goal is to find a balance between caution and realism. You don’t want to overestimate the risk and end up undervaluing a great company, but you also don’t want to underestimate the risk and overpay for something that might fail.

## Conclusion

Estimating risk premiums is both practical and intuitive. It’s not about following a rigid formula—it’s about understanding the specific risks a company and its industry face, and then applying reasonable premiums to reflect those risks. Historical data can give you a starting point, but intuition and experience are just as important.

The key is to think clearly about the risks involved. Ask yourself, _How fragile is this company? How likely is this industry to be disrupted? What would I be worried about if I were investing in this company?_ The answers to those questions will guide you to reasonable estimates of the risk premiums. And in the end, those estimates are what will help you value companies more accurately.
