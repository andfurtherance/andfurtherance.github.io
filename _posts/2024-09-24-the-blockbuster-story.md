## The Timeline
- In 1988, Blockbuster became the most popular video store chain in the US, with 800 stores.
- In 1992, it expanded overseas and bought video-rental chain Ritz in the UK with 2,800 Blockbuster stores.
- During early 2000, Blockbuster had over 9,000 stores worldwide and over 45 million registered users. It had an extensive movie colletion and an unrivaled space, making it the most convenient store for all in-house entertainment and snacking.

## Why the Fall?
### Undermining customer satisfaction
- **Blockbuster's income was mainly based on late fees**: Reliance on penalizing its customers for its income was not a lasting strategy.
- **Didn't shift to online**: When the world was shifting to online streaming, Blockbuster continued with its traditional rental model and charged its customers per rental. The tradtiional rental model was becoming less appealing as they looked for convenience and ease.
> Netflix, on the other hand, recognized the deamand for online streaming. It made this the core component of its business. It basically provided greater value and convenience to customers, making it more appealing than Blockbuster's reantal model.

## Opportunities
- Blockbuster had raised $465 million in an IPO in 1999.
- Netflix, established in 1997, sought to sell its business to Blockbuster for $50 million in 2000.
- The deal would have put Netflix in charge of Blockbuster's online operations.
- The deal was turned down by Blockbuster. Let's find out the details about this deal, let's find the source document(s) if possible.
- Blockbuster's reasoning was that the price was too high. It suggests that they did consider the deal.

## Further Worse
- Viacom sold its majority stake in 2004.
- The Total Access Program was a failure that incurred them further loss. Find out what was this program, why it was rolled out. Was it to counter Netflix which had 6 million users by then.
- Blockbuster was purchased by Dish Network in 2011 when its number of locations had come down from 9,000 (during their hey day) to 600 locations.

## Leadership Dispute
- Carl Icahn fought against the company's entry into the online rental market, urging to remain to its brick-and-mortar origins. Why would he do it? Let's find out.
- After firing John Antioco in 2007, Jim Keyes joined as CEO who was also dedicated to its physical and mortar operations.
- Niko Celentano, a former Blockbuster shareholder, wrote after Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010:
> Jum keyes is the main reason Blockbuster is in this position today due to this denial of being in a business model that did not work anymore. If Jim Keyes would have seen the chagnes that were evolving in this industry in the past few years, Blockbuster would not have been in the courts today filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection... Jim Keyes has failed in his job as CEO of Blockbuster and should resign immediately.
- Tom Casey, former Chief Finanancial officer of Blockbuster said:
> Most people think Blockbuster went out of business because of Netflix. What really happened was Blockbuster and Netflix were pretty evenly positioned to grow in the mid-2000s and 2007, '08 and '09. They had capital, We did not. `This one is interesting as well as what Niko Celentano wrote. Can we find more such actual crude articles, letters or statements and delve deeper into them?`

## Concluding
- Blockbuster failed because
    - It failed to adapt to changing market conditions
    - Had poor customer service
    - Had high rental fees
    - Relied on a revenue model that penalized the customers
    - Was unable to understand and adapt to client preferences
