*Money follows furtherance, not the other way around.*

In fields where fortune's whispers call,  
They chase the gains, both big and small.  
But wise ones know what’s truly sound—  
Money follows furtherance, not the other way around.

The seeds of wealth are rarely fast,  
They're sown in toil, in efforts vast.  
It’s in the roots, beneath the ground,  
Where value grows before it's found.

The dreamers seek returns today,  
Without the work that paves the way.  
But riches, they are only crowned  
When furtherance is tightly bound.

For in the order, clear and true,  
The labor comes before the view.  
Of harvests bright, of treasures sound—  
Money follows furtherance, not the other way around.

So plant the seeds, and wait your time,  
Let action be your steady rhyme.  
The wealth will rise, when roots are sound,  
Money follows furtherance, not the other way around.
