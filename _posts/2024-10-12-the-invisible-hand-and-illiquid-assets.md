The invisible hand feels like it should apply to everything. Markets, guided by individual self-interest, should naturally allocate resources in the most efficient way. In theory, this means that illiquid assets--those that can't easily be sold or converted to cash--should offer higher returns than their liquid counterparts. Why should anyone prefer lock their money up if they could get the same return from a more liquid investment?

But, things don't always work out that neatly. The invisible hand is a powerful force, but it's not infallible, and sometimes it gets tangled in the complexities of human behavior, socio-politics, market distortions and systematic risks.
## The Liquidity Premium
Liquidity has value. If you can sell an asset quickly without affecting its price, you have more flexibility, more control. You can react to new information, take advantage of opportunities or avoid disaster. Illiquidity, on the other hand, ties your hands.

So, in a perfect rational market, investors should demand--and receive--a premium for holding illiquid assets. Illiquid assets should offer something extra to compensate for its lack of flexibility, otherwise no one would invest in it.
## Why It May Not Hold
### 1. Illiquidity as a Feature, not a Bug
For some investors, illiquidity is actually a selling point. This seems counterintuitive, but it makes sense when you think about how people behave in practice rather than theory.

Some investors value illiquidity because it forces them to be patient. These investors have long-term obligations and don't want to be tempted by short-term impulses and market fluctuations. By locking their money into illiquid assets, they're committing to a long-term strategy. Illiquidity acts as a forced discipline, preventing individuals and managers from making rash decisions when markets turn volatile.
### 2. Overconfidence in Long-Term Return
Many investors believe that illiquid assets will offer higher returns in the future, even if they don't see those returns right away. This is especially true in markets where there's a belief that only sophisticated investors have access to illiquid opportunities.

For example, venture capital is notoriously illiquid. It can take years or even decades to see a return on venture investment, and even then, most startups fail. But investors are often drawn to venture capital because they believe that the few winners will more than make up for the losers. This belief in future upside can lead investors to accept lower returns in the short-term, or to overlook the risks of illiquidity altogether.

In some cases, this belief is justified. But in others, it's just wishful thinking. Investors convince themselves that they're getting on the ground floor of the next big thing, even when the odds are stacked against them.
### 3. Market Distortions and the Search for Yield
When central banks food the financial system with cheap money in an effort to stimulate growth, the interest rates get pushed down. Consequently, investors are forced to search for yield wherever they can find it. Market distortions caused by notable investors by way of their investments can also lead to similar situations--Nepal is a good case for this.

This leads to a situation where investors are willing to take on more risk and accept lower returns just to find something that offers a better yield than bank deposits. Illiquid assets, which traditionally offer higher yields, might get bid up to the point where their returns stop being commensurate with their risks.

For example, real estate is an illiquid asset--it takes time to sell a property and prices can be volatile. But we've all seen real estate prices soar. Investors have piled into real estate not because it's liquid, but because they believe it's one of the few places where they can still earn a decent return. As a result, illiquidity premium has shrunk in this case, and some investors have accepted lower returns for assets that are still hard to sell.
### 4. The Illusion of Liquidity
Consider the market for stocks or bonds. In normal times, they're fairly liquid--investors can buy and sell them without too much trouble. But during times of market stress, liquidity can dry up quickly. In a financial crisis, it can be nearly impossible to sell a corporate bond without taking a huge loss.

This creates a situation where investors might think they're holding liquid assets, but in reality, those assets are only liquid under certain conditions. When the market turns, investors could find themselves stuck with illiquid assets that don't offer the returns they expected.

### 5. Socio-Political Factors
One often-overlooked reason why illiquid assets might not offer higher returns is the role of socio-political factors. Markets don't operate in a vacuum. They're influenced by political realities, regulatory environment and social trends. These factors can distort the relationship between liquidity and returns.

For example, governments often subsidize or offer favorable tax treatment to certain types of illiquid investments. These incentives can artificially inflate the actual and perceived returns on illiquid assets, making them more attractive than they otherwise would be. Investors might flock not because of the liquidity premium but because they're trying to take advantage of tax-breaks or government subsidies.

## To Conclude
The idea that illiquid assets should offer higher returns makes sense in theory. But in the real world, things are messier. Investors sometimes accept lower returns on illiquid assets because illiquidity forces discipline, because they’re overconfident in future gains, because of market distortions, or because they believe an asset is more liquid than it really is.

The invisible hand is a powerful force, but it’s not perfect. Markets can be distorted, investors can be irrational, and liquidity can be an illusion. In the end, the relationship between liquidity and returns is more complicated than the theory suggests. And sometimes, illiquidity doesn’t pay off the way it’s supposed to.
