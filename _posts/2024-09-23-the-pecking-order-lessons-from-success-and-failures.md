In the world of business and investments, we often find ourselves chasing after quick wins. We hear success stories—like those of **Apple** or **Amazon**—and wonder how we can replicate their triumphs. But what if the key to success lies not in chasing money but in understanding the journey of furtherance? 

## The Foundation: Building Before Reaping

Let’s take a look at **Apple**. When **Steve Jobs** returned in 1997, the company was on the brink of collapse. Jobs didn’t just rush to make money; he focused on creating a culture of innovation and excellence. He understood that building a solid foundation was essential. Apple invested in design, user experience, and technology, nurturing these elements over time. The result? A remarkable transformation into one of the most valuable companies in the world. 

Jobs wasn’t just trying to sell more iPods; he was furthering the idea of what a computer could be—an experience, not just a product. Money followed the commitment to quality and vision, not the other way around.

## The Perils of Shortcuts: The Case of Blockbuster

Contrast this with **Blockbuster**, a company that once dominated video rental. They had an opportunity to buy **Netflix** for a mere $50 million. Blockbuster’s leaders were focused on immediate profits from their stores rather than furthering the idea of home entertainment. They thought they could keep doing what they had always done. But they failed to innovate, and as a result, they became a relic of the past. 

Blockbuster's story is a stark reminder that money doesn’t just flow in because you want it to; it follows the deeper currents of progress and adaptation. When you ignore these currents, you risk being swept away.

## The Slow Path of Furtherance: Amazon’s Evolution

Now consider **Amazon**. **Jeff Bezos** started selling books online, a humble beginning indeed. But he didn’t stop there. He continued to evolve, expanding into various sectors—music, cloud computing, and now groceries. Bezos understood that the path to success isn’t a straight line; it’s about continuously nurturing and expanding ideas.

Each step was a furtherance of the initial vision: to be the most customer-centric company on Earth. This commitment led to **Amazon Web Services**, which revolutionized how businesses think about technology. Money flowed in as a byproduct of dedication to customer needs and innovative thinking.

## The Balance of Risk and Patience

**Investing** also reflects this principle. Think about **Warren Buffett**. His approach isn’t about the next hot stock; it’s about the long game. He looks for companies with solid fundamentals and a strong potential for future growth. His patience and commitment to understanding businesses have made him one of the wealthiest people in the world. 

Buffett knows that money will follow furtherance. The more you invest in understanding a company, its market, and its potential, the more likely you are to see returns in the long run.

## Conclusion: The Spirit of the Pecking Order

The spirit of my poem, "The Pecking Order," is about recognizing that true success comes from nurturing ideas and committing to furtherance. Whether you’re building a business or making an investment, remember that money is a byproduct of dedication, vision, and patience.

Take a page from the stories of Apple, Amazon, and Buffett. Focus on building a solid foundation. Embrace innovation, and don’t fear the long path. The results will come, not because you chased money, but because you honored the journey of progress and commitment. In this pecking order of life and business, furtherance is what leads the way—money will follow.
