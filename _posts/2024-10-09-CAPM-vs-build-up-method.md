CAPM vs. Build-Up Method: A Detailed Comparison
If you’re in finance, or you’ve ever tried to value a company, you’ve probably encountered both the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Build-Up Method. These are two of the most common ways to determine the cost of equity, which is a key input in any valuation model, especially the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method.

The problem is, while both CAPM and the Build-Up Method aim to do the same thing, they approach it in radically different ways. And depending on what kind of company you’re valuing, one method might be far better than the other—though neither is perfect.

In this essay, I’ll break down the differences between CAPM and the Build-Up Method, and explain when each one works—and when it doesn’t. But to understand that, we need to start with the basics: what each model is trying to do, and why it matters.

What Are We Trying to Measure?
At the core of both CAPM and the Build-Up Method is a deceptively simple question: How much return should an investor expect for taking on risk? In other words, if you’re going to invest in a company, especially one that’s not guaranteed to succeed, how much compensation should you demand for taking that risk?

This is important because the return investors demand—what we call the cost of equity—affects how much the company is worth today. If investors demand a high return, the company is worth less, because future cash flows have to be discounted at a higher rate. If investors are willing to accept a lower return, the company is worth more.

Both CAPM and the Build-Up Method are ways of estimating that return. But they take very different routes to get there.

CAPM: Top-Down and Market-Driven
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a top-down, market-driven approach. It’s based on the idea that investors should be compensated for two things: the time value of money (because a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow) and risk (because risky investments should pay more than safe ones).

The formula for CAPM looks like this:

$Expected Return=R_f+\beta(R_m−R_f)$

Where:
- Rf is the risk free rate
- $ \beta $ is the beta
- Rm is the expected market return
​
The Risk-Free Rate
The risk-free rate is easy. It’s the return on something that’s essentially guaranteed, like U.S. Treasury bonds. If you could invest in something totally safe, what would your return be? That’s the baseline return any investor should demand, because they can always choose the safe option instead of taking on more risk.

Beta and Market Risk
The tricky part of CAPM is the beta. Beta measures how much a company’s stock price moves in relation to the overall market. If a company has a beta of 1, it moves exactly with the market. If the market goes up 10%, the company’s stock goes up 10%. If the market drops 10%, the stock drops 10%. A beta of 2 means the company’s stock is twice as volatile as the market. A beta of 0.5 means it’s half as volatile.

In theory, companies with higher betas should provide higher returns, because they’re riskier. If an investor is going to risk more volatility, they should be compensated with higher returns.

The Market Premium
The market premium is the difference between the return on a risky investment (like the stock market) and the risk-free rate. Historically, this premium has been around 5-7%, depending on how you measure it and how far back you go. This is the extra return investors expect from the stock market over and above the return on government bonds.

Put it all together, and CAPM gives you an estimate of the return investors should demand for investing in a particular company, based on how risky that company is relative to the overall market.

Strengths of CAPM
CAPM works pretty well for public companies, especially large, established ones. That’s because you have a lot of data to work with. You can look up the company’s beta, see how its stock price moves relative to the market, and use that to estimate the cost of equity. And because CAPM is based on market data, it’s grounded in reality—at least, as much as the stock market is grounded in reality.

CAPM also has the advantage of being simple and widely accepted. If you’re presenting a valuation to investors or a board of directors, using CAPM gives you credibility, because it’s the standard approach in finance. Everyone knows what CAPM is, and everyone understands how it works.

Weaknesses of CAPM
But CAPM has some big weaknesses, especially when you’re dealing with private companies or startups. The biggest problem is that beta is hard to measure for companies that don’t have stock prices. If the company isn’t publicly traded, you can’t calculate how its stock moves relative to the market, because there’s no stock to measure.

So what do you do? Most people just use the beta of a similar public company. If you’re valuing a private tech startup, you might use the beta of a big public tech company like Apple or Google. But that’s a big assumption. A startup is much riskier than an established company, so using the beta of a public company often underestimates the true risk.

Another problem with CAPM is that it assumes market risk is the only kind of risk that matters. But that’s not true for private companies. Private companies face all kinds of risks that public companies don’t. They might be dependent on a single customer, or have trouble raising capital, or be run by a founder who’s key to the business. These risks don’t show up in beta, but they’re real, and they can have a huge impact on the cost of equity.

The Build-Up Method: Bottom-Up and Risk-Focused
The Build-Up Method takes a completely different approach. Instead of starting with the market and working down, the Build-Up Method starts with a baseline return and adds premiums for all the different risks a company faces.

The formula for the Build-Up Method looks like this:

Expected Return

𝑅
𝑓

Equity Risk Premium

Size Premium

Industry Risk Premium
+
Company-Specific Risk Premium
Expected Return=R 
f
​
 +Equity Risk Premium+Size Premium+Industry Risk Premium+Company-Specific Risk Premium
Starting with the Risk-Free Rate
Like CAPM, the Build-Up Method starts with the risk-free rate. That’s the baseline return any investor should get for taking no risk at all.

Adding Risk Premiums
But instead of using beta to estimate risk, the Build-Up Method adds different risk premiums to the risk-free rate. These premiums are meant to capture all the different kinds of risks a company faces, not just market risk.

The Equity Risk Premium
The Equity Risk Premium is the same as the market premium in CAPM. It’s the extra return investors demand for investing in stocks instead of bonds. This premium reflects the general risk of investing in equities.

The Size Premium
The Size Premium reflects the fact that smaller companies are riskier than larger ones. Small companies have fewer customers, less market power, and are more vulnerable to economic shocks. Investors demand a higher return for taking on this extra risk. The smaller the company, the bigger the size premium.

The Industry Risk Premium
The Industry Risk Premium captures the specific risks of the industry the company operates in. Some industries are riskier than others. For example, tech companies face more volatility and disruption than utility companies. The Build-Up Method adds a premium to account for these industry-specific risks.

The Company-Specific Risk Premium
Finally, the Company-Specific Risk Premium captures the unique risks that apply to the individual company you’re valuing. This could include things like reliance on a single customer, dependence on a key founder, or lack of access to capital. These are risks that don’t show up in the market or industry data, but they’re real, and they affect the company’s cost of equity.

Strengths of the Build-Up Method
The Build-Up Method shines when you’re valuing private companies, especially small ones or startups. That’s because it doesn’t rely on beta or market data, which are hard to come by for private companies. Instead, it focuses on the specific risks the company faces, which makes it more flexible and adaptable to different kinds of businesses.

Another advantage of the Build-Up Method is that it forces you to think about all the different kinds of risks a company faces. Instead of just looking at market risk, like CAPM does, the Build-Up Method makes you consider size, industry, and company-specific risks. This gives you a more comprehensive view of the company’s risk profile.

Weaknesses of the Build-Up Method
But the Build-Up Method has its own weaknesses. One of the biggest is that it’s subjective. How do you decide what the size premium should be? How do you quantify company-specific risks? There’s no single right answer. Different analysts might come up with different premiums, depending on how they view the company’s risks. This makes the Build-Up Method less precise than CAPM, and more open to interpretation.

Another weakness is that the Build-Up Method doesn’t account for market risk as precisely as CAPM does. It lumps all the risks together in different premiums, but it doesn’t tell you how the company’s returns move relative to the market. This can be a problem if you’re trying to compare the company to other investments in the market, because you don’t have a clear sense of how much the company’s risk is tied to the overall economy.

When to Use CAPM vs. the Build-Up Method
So, when should you use CAPM, and when should you use the Build-Up Method?

Use CAPM for Public Companies
CAPM works best for large, public companies with lots of market data. If you can calculate beta accurately, CAPM gives you a good estimate of the company’s cost of equity based on how its stock moves relative to the market. This makes CAPM a good choice for valuing established companies in stable industries, where market risk is the biggest concern.

Use the Build-Up Method for Private Companies
The Build-Up Method is better for private companies, especially small ones or startups. That’s because it doesn’t rely on market data, which is often unavailable for private companies. Instead, it focuses on the specific risks the company faces, which makes it more flexible and adaptable. The Build-Up Method is also useful when you’re valuing companies in volatile or high-risk industries, where market risk isn’t the only concern.

The Best of Both Worlds?
Some analysts try to combine CAPM and the Build-Up Method to get the best of both worlds. They use CAPM to estimate market risk, and then add specific premiums for size, industry, and company-specific risks. This hybrid approach can give you a more nuanced view of a company’s cost of equity, but it also adds complexity and subjectivity.

Conclusion
Both CAPM and the Build-Up Method have their strengths and weaknesses. CAPM is simple, widely accepted, and works well for public companies with lots of market data. But it falls short when you’re dealing with private companies or startups, where beta is hard to measure and where market risk isn’t the only concern.

The Build-Up Method, on the other hand, is more flexible and adaptable, especially for private companies. It forces you to think about all the different risks a company faces, not just market risk. But it’s also more subjective and less precise than CAPM.

In the end, the right method depends on what kind of company you’re valuing. If you’re valuing a public company, CAPM is probably the way to go. But if you’re valuing a private company, especially a small one or a startup, the Build-Up Method will give you a better estimate of the company’s true cost of equity.
