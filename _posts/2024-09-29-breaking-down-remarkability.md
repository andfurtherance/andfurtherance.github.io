We haven't had power since two days now. It was hard. It was worse because the power went out Friday night and it is Sunday today. An entire weekend, after a rather dissonance-filled work-week, is wasted. With no devices on and with no Internet, I experienced withdrawal symptoms. When nothing helped, I turned to books. I picked up The Power Broker and took it till the chapter "Driving" completing 2 chapters in total. I also picked up Contagious. I wish I had done it some months before. I read maybe a few pages. I paused at the part of "Remarkability". I think this is worthy to be given some deeper look. **Let's break it down**.

## 1. What is Remarkability
- Something is remarkable when it stands out from the ordinary and prompts people to talk about it.
- Remarkability is about being memorable or attention-grabbing in a way that compels others to remark on it.

## What Makes Something Remarkable?
- Novelty: It introduces something that is new and unexpected to the audience or recipient.
- Emotion: It elicits strong feelings--it could be excitement, admiration or curiosity.
- Value: It offers something of significant worth or usefulness that others find hard to ignore.
- Social Currency: People talk about remakable things because sharing them boosts their own status in a social group. **I find this particularly interesting. Think of the last time you inadvertently shared soemthing you had read, heard, seen, listened or experienced. Bet there was some bit of exaggeration invovled when you shared it--not because you intended to but because our memories are imperfect.**.

## Remarkability in Personal Character
- Authenticity: Being genuine and **true to yourself** creates a foundation for remarkability. People are more likely to remark on someone who doesn't try to fit in or conform but lives by their own values and standards. **I would stress on being true to yourself and being self-assured. That has to be the foundation stone for everything that you want to accomplish. But projecting it in a way that is worthy of positive remark is equally important**.
  > Being **true to yourself** and **self-assured** merit their own break-down.
- Courage: Taking bold actions, especially when others hesitate, can set you apart. Whether it's standing up for what you feel is right or stepping out of your comfort zone, courages makes a lasting impression. **It alwaways does, and it is what everyone ever needs--everything else will follow**.
  > **Boldness in action**, **courage** and how it differentiates remarkable people from the ordinary also merits its own break-down.

## Remarkability in Persion
- Consistency in Excellence: Remarkability isn't a one-time event. Consistently performing at a high-level creates a long-lasting, remarkable person.
  > Regularly building and showcasing your skills consistently builds trust and turns you into a reference point for others.
- Differentiation: In a crowd, remarkability often comes from differentiation. What makes you unique? Are you solving problems or appraoching things in ways no one else is? This requires to be complemented by courage.
- Storytelling: People remember storeis better than facts. Your person becomes remarkable when your journey, struggles or vision are communicated through powerful narratives.

## Key Questions for Reflecting on Remarkability
- What are your unique strengths and traits? How do these differentiate you from others?
- Are you living authentically, or are you trying to comform to expecations build upon you by society, parents, friends, movies, music, stories, etc?
- Do your actions and behavior consistently align with your personal values? What are your personal values?
  How can you consistently deliver value in a way that others can't?
- What stores from your life and work are worth sharing, and how do they reflect your personal brand?
